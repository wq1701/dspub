# Script Generating

The idea comes from a project back in LeeLab@CUIMC when I had to deal with 1000+ matlab scripts awaiting submission to the C2B2 HPC. 

The solution was to generate those matlab scripts with R, and then use a shell loop for submission. 

Then the solution was adapted to designing the waterfall automation in CIME@IQVIA. While coded in Python, the gists are similar.
